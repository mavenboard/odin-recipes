        <li>16 oz. Elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 Rotisserie-roasted Chicken</li>
        <li>6 tbsp. Butter</li>
        <li>6 tbsp. All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 cups Milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups Shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups Shredded Montery Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Hot sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. </li>
        <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Remove skin and bones from wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-sized pieces. </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Gradually whisk in flour until a thick paste forms. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season with pepper. </li>
        <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack into the sauce until melted and combined. </li>
        <li>Stir in hot sauce to the desired level of spiciness.</li>
        <li>Add Gorgonzola, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
